# Product Management

This project is a React application that allows users to manage and showcase a collection of products. It provides functionality to add new products, update existing products, and delete products. The application utilizes modern web development technologies such as React, Redux, and Axios for handling the frontend logic and making API calls to the backend server.

## Key Features:

1. Product Management: Users can add new products by providing details such as name, category, description, and an optional image upload. They can also update the information of existing products or remove products from their collection.

2. Category Dropdown: The product form includes a dropdown menu for selecting the category of the product. It provides a predefined set of categories to choose from, including Electronics, Gadgets, Clothing, Home & Kitchen, and more.

3. Image Upload: Users can upload an image file for each product. The application handles the multipart form data submission using the Axios library and ensures that the image is sent along with other product details to the backend server.

4. Authentication and Authorization: The application integrates with a user authentication system, allowing only authenticated users to access the product management functionality. It uses tokens for authorization and includes Redux reducers to manage the user's authentication state.

5. Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project serves as a starting point for building a product management application in React, providing a foundation for further customization and expansion based on specific requirements.
